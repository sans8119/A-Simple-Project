Showing a excersise video on android.

Functionality: 
- When the app is opened it shows the exercise view
- That exercise view has a countdown and the user has to perform as many repetitions as he/she can
- Once the countdown completes, the view promps the user about the number of repetitions he/she did
- A button to skip the exercise (if the user tries to skip the app is going to ask for the reps also)
