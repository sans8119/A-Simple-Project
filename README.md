Showing a excersise video on android.

Due to lack of a working android device the code is not yet tested. Due to some reasons emulator is not lounching on my computer.
Hence have not tested the working of the code yet. Will be doing a first round of testing on the device as soon as I can get a hand on one of the android devices.

Functionality: 
- When the app is opened it shows the exercise view
- That exercise view has a countdown and the user has to perform as many repetitions as he/she can
- Once the countdown completes, the view promps the user about the number of repetitions he/she did
- A button to skip the exercise (if the user tries to skip the app is going to ask for the reps also)
